Start with basic hero class
get people baking as soon as possible 

start with simple examples and build complexity

tests should be for example only not for full test coverage of code.

User add health to hero class as exercise

Add break to battle (if all dead do something...)

add format strings instead of + operator

describe default values, why they are nice and how to deal with None's

polymorphism - Write method, then call it and ponder "isn't that weird" 
Why does it work?

split "tests" into separate file all classes in own file
