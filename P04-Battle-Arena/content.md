## Creating the Battle Arena
Our heroes need a place to fight. This means that we're going to need an object that will manage our game for us. This object will make sure that each team gets a chance to attack the other. These are the methods that need to be completed for this to work.

```python
class Arena:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        self.team_one = None
        self.team_two = None
        """

    def build_team_one(self):
        """
        This method should allow a user to build team one.
        """

    def build_team_two(self):
        """
        This method should allow user to build team two.
        """
    
    def team_battle(self):
        """
        This method should battle the teams until one team is dead.
        """
